	/// In general, objects instances which implement this interface should be single threaded,
	/// but depending upon custom IoC container wire-up configuration and/or handler registration,
	/// a specific instance which implements this interface may be designed to be multi-thread safe
	/// allowing it to be shared across threads.  A single-threaded handler will typically have the
	/// lifespan of a single, logical message whereas a multi-threaded handler may have a variable
	/// lifespan dependening upon the container wire-up registration.
